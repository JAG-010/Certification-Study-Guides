AZ 900 notes

Intro
1.Basic characteristics of cloud model/ computing
Cloud computing is a remote virtual pool of on demand shared resources of compute, storage, database and network that can be rapidly deployed  on scale.
2. Cloud models (private/public/hybrid)
3. Cloud services (Iaas,Paas,Saas)
4. Economic at scale
5. Capex/ Opex

Security, privacy, compliance and Trust

Securing Network Connectivity
Defense in Depth strategy - mechanism  to slow the advance of an attack that was aimed acquiring unauthorised access to data
Confidentiality - principle of least privilege
Integrity- prevention of unauthorised changes to info during transit
Availability - ensure service remains available to authorised users protecting from attacks like DDos
6 layers of protection
1. Physical
2. Identity and access
3. Perimeter
4. Network
5. Compute
6. Application 

Azure firewall 
- managed network security service in azure protects Azure virtual network resources - Fully stateful Firewall as a service
-uses static public ip to represent virtual network and fully integrated with azure monitor
Azure application gateway - provides firewall called WAF - web application firewall which provides centralised inbound protection for web applications

Azure DDos Protection :- available In all region by default 
	Basic tier - automatically enabled - always ON traffic monitoring
	Standard Tier - adds additional mitigation capabilities - tuned especially for azure network resources - mainly associated with azure public ip deployments like LB and resources attached to public ip. Prevents volumetric, protocol and resource layer attacks.

Network Security Group(NSG)
- Filters network traffic to and fro from azure resources connected to azure virtual network
- Contains inbound and outbound rules
- Name- priority- Source/Destination- protocol- direction- port range- Action
- Has default rules that cannot be removed but overridden

Application security Groups:
- Configure network security as an extension of an app structure
- Groups vm and then apply network security based on those grouping

Choosing Azure Network security Solution
	Perimeter layer - protects network boundaries using Azure DDos protection and Azure firewall
	Networking Layer - allows traffic to pass between networked resources inbound and outbound rules defined
 Azure VPN gateway
Azure expressroute
Azure network service endpoints
Azure Core identity Services
	Authentication - process of establishing identification of the identity
	Authorization - establish level of access what the authenticated entities has
Role based access control
Azure Active Directory
- Microsoft identity and access management service
- provides authentication, single signal, application management, B2B identity service , B2C service, Device management
Azure multi-factor authentication
- limits impact of stolen credentials like OTP, notification, biometric etc..
* A knowledge factor - something the user knows.
* A possession factor - something the user owns, such as an email address or mobile device.
* An inheritance factor - something that confirms identity via a physical characteristic, such as a fingerprint or other biometric.
- 
Azure active directory Domain service

Security Tools and features
	
- Azure security centre - provide threat protection services In azure and onprem - continuously monitors services and performs automatic security assessment - analyse and identify inbound attacks and investigate risks
    - Two tiers - Free and standard
-  Azure key vault - stores app secrets in centralised cloud location to securely control access permission and access logging

Azure Governance
- Azure policy - create, assign and manage policy that enforce rules and effects over your resource
    - Can also integrate with azure devops
    - Create definition - > Assign definition -> review results ( three steps implementing azure policy)
- Policy initiatives
    - Initiative definition - group multiple policy definitions into a single unit to track compliance at a higher scope
    - Initiative assignment - assigned to specific scope and reduce the need to make an initiative definition for each scope
- Role based access control (RBAC) 
    - Fine grained access management for azure resources
    - Based on allow model ( by default allows user to access specific resource by default)
- Resource Locks
    - Used to prevent accidental deletion of modification did azure resources. Looks are managed from within the azure portal
    - Cannot delete (read and update not delete) and readonly (only read, no update and delete)
- Azure Blueprint
    - Define repeatable sets of azure resources that implement and adhere to standards, patterns and requirements
    - Like instance templates, Iaac like terraform, cloud formation
    - Create azure blueprint -> assign blueprint -> track blueprint assignment
    - Diff b/w azure resource manager templates and blueprints
        - Resource manager templates - have no active relationship with deployed resources
        - Blueprint - tied to azure blueprint package - relationship bow resource is maintained even after deployment
- Subscription governance
Monitoring and Reporting
- Azure tags - logically organize azure resources - adding meta data to them - name value pair eg: env : prod or env : developement 
    - Helps in billing 
    - Tag limitations - not all resource types support tags, maximum 50 tags(Rg&resources) - 15 tags for storage accounts 
    - Tag name - 512 chars : tag value - 256 chars storage acc - > tag name : 128 chars tag value : 256chars
    - VM scale sets total of 2048 chars tag names and values 
    - Not inherited to resources under resource grps if applied to Rg level
- Azure Monitor - collect ,analyse and act upon telemetry from both cloud and on Prem env
    - Application monitoring data
    - Guest os monitoring data
    - Azure resource monitoring data
    - Azure subscription monitoring data
    - Azure tenant monitoring data
- Azure service Health - provides personalised guidance and support whenever issues with azure services affect you
    - Azure status
    - Azure service health
    - Azure resource health
- Monitoring apps and services - data monitoring to gain visibility ops of your computing env
    - Analyze  -application insights , azure monitor for containers, azure monitor for vm
    - Respond - email and text alerts; automated process(autoscale)
    - Visualize - charts, tables, dashboards and views
    - Integrate - other azure services can work with azure monitor
