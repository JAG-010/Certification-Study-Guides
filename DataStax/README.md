## Which certification should I get?

The **Administrator Certification** is designed for professionals who install, configure, manage and tune the performance of Apache Cassandra clusters, such as database administrators, DevOps engineers and Site Reliability Engineers (SREs).

The **Developer Certification** is designed for professionals that use Apache Cassandra clusters to manage data. This includes roles such as application developers, data architects, database designers, and database administrators.

## Free Vouchers

DataStax often conducts primerily virtual workshops, where they distribute free certification vouchers to the attendees. A voucher code can usually be applied for any of two exams (admin or developer). Every voucher guarantees two attempts in on of the following combination: either two attempts of one kind of the exam (admin or developer) OR one attempt of each kind of the exam. Thus, if passed from the 1st attempt, one voucher code can be used to earn both certifications (admin & developer).
